*Preparation*
1. Soak the beans in water until they are covered the night before their preparation; Cook them in that same water, with half the oil. When they are soft, add salt.
2. Meanwhile, sauté the ground beef in oil over medium high heat adding half of the hogao and stir well. Fry the pork rinds until they are toasted or to the desired point.
3. When the beans are soft, add the remaining stew and cook an additional 5 to 10 minutes to thicken them. Then, in a pan, place oil to fry sweet bananas or patacones and fried eggs.
4. Hogao or stew: Mix everything and cook it in a pan for 10 minutes
5. Arepas: In a bowl large enough to knead, place the corn flour. On the flour add oil. Add salt to the water, pour it and mix until you get a consistent dough. Make a ball of dough in your hand and flatten it with your two hands to give it a round shape.
6. Then in a pan with little oil, roast the arepas until both sides are browned.
7. Mix all and serve
